### Work

In my daily work I'm a computer nerd. I tend to focus on "back-end" software
engineering, system administration, and cloud architecture in various forms.
Eventually I would like to bridge the gap and incorporate "front-end" skills
as well, though I'm still waiting on the right set of tools to make this a
more enjoyable experience ([WASM](https://webassembly.org/), are we there
yet?).

### This website

This site is brought to you by the magic of your web browser, numerous
decentralized lookup and routing services, and a global content delivery
network that is itself backed by the redundant storage technology of a major
cloud provider. The content is "static", so your web browser only needs to
interpret it once, within a few milliseconds of retrieval. I do not betray
your interests with tracking cookies or javascript, but I do capture request
logs, which include IP address and user agent. All of this costs me about $20
per year, and most of that is for the annual administrative fee to claim the
domain name.

The source content is written in UTF-8 encoded text using a domain specific
language (DSL) designed to abstract the author's intent from the actual
presentation markup that your browser understands. This source is processed
through a custom program constructed using *another* DSL that is designed to
*orchestrates DSL conversion processes* (!). It is DSLs all the way down so
that the computer does all of the tedious work for me as it should be.

No Monads were harmed in the production of this website. If you don't believe
me, the source is committed to a distributed version control system and is
available for review at
[github.com/psftw/psftw-blog](https://github.com/psftw/psftw-blog).
