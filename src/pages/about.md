### Work

In my daily work I'm a computer nerd. I tend to focus on "back-end" software
engineering, system administration, and cloud architecture in various forms.

### This website

This site is brought to you by the magic of your web browser, numerous
decentralized lookup and routing services, and a global content delivery
network. The content is "static", so your web browser only needs to interpret
it once, within a few milliseconds of retrieval. I do not betray you with
tracking cookies or thirdparty javascript, but I do capture basic request logs,
which include IP address and user agent. All of this costs me about $20 per
year, and most of that is for the annual administrative fee to claim the domain
name. The source content is available at
[github.com/psftw/psftw-blog](https://github.com/psftw/psftw-blog).
