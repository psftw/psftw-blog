# {frontmatter.title}

Jython is an implementation of Python on the JVM. It offers Python developers
access to the Java ecosystem at the cost of C extensions and some
convenience. See [jython.org](https://www.jython.org) for more details and up
to date information.

> **NOTE:** Jython 2.7.0 final was released in May 2015, two years after this
post, which is left as-is for historical reasons.

Despite being largely successful with Jython 2.5.2 in the past, I did have to
monkey patch some "pure" Python libraries to get them to work.  Most of the
problems stemmed from code that took advantage of newer syntax.  Others were
trickier to resolve (file descriptor leaks), and a few were not worth the
trouble.  Needless to say, the 2.7 beta release announcement looked promising:

> Jython 2.7b1 brings us up to language level compatibility with the 2.7
version of CPython. We have focused largely on CPython compatibility, and so
this release of Jython can run more pure Python apps then any previous
release.

In my limited experience, I can confirm these claims.  The Java library support
has always worked well, and now the pure Python support has received a huge
boost. *Thank you Jython dev team!*

## Try it out yourself

Install Jython using the "Traditional Installer"

```shell
$ java -jar jython-installer-2.7-b1.jar -s -d env
```

Bootstrap setuptools

```shell
$ env/bin/jython ez_setup.py 
```

Install a pure Python library

```shell
$ env/bin/easy_install mako
```

Install a Java library (such as jyson) by dropping the jar in to
``env/javalib``.  I also needed to update ``env/bin/jython`` to fix the
classpath generation script:

```diff
- CP=$JYTHON_HOME/jython-dev.jar
+ CP=$JYTHON_HOME/jython.jar
```

Verify both libraries are importable

```python
Jython 2.7b1 (default:ac42d59644e9, Feb 9 2013, 15:24:52) 
[OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (Oracle Corporation)] on java1.7.0_21
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import mako
>>> import com.xhaus.jyson.JysonCodec as json
```

Thats it!  You just mixed python and Java code.
